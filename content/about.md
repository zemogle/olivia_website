I am a graduate from the Royal Welsh College of Music & Drama and studies under Beatrice Unsworth and Michael Pollock. I am delighted to be performing for Live Music Now, a musical outreach organisation founded by Yehudi Menuhin and Ian Stoutzker that brings live music to those suffering with dementia and people with special needs and disabilities.

My operatic experiences includes Narrator in the first staged production of Dirty Beasts (Irvine), which toured primary schools in the South Wales, Miss Prism in The Importance of being Earnest (Barry) for Contemporary Opera Scenes with Music Theatre Wales and Nancy in Albert Herring (Britten) for RWCMD. Currently I sings with the BBC National Chorus of Wales and during my time with them I have performed various step out solos including in a recording of Arthur Sullivan's 'The Beauty Stone' where I sang alongside Rebecca Evans, Elin Manahan Thomas & Toby Spence as a soloist and has just finished the first ever UK tour of the Doctor Who Symphonic Spectacular.

Solo performances and recitals include a performance alongside the Cardiff Polyphonic Choir in their 50th Anniversary Concert, the alto soloist for Mendelssohnâ€™s 'Elijah' in Taunton. Last October I revisited this at St John Smiths Square in a Three Choirs Awareness Concert, the alto soloist for the Monteverdi Vespers with Llandaff Cathedral Choral Society, alongside Catherine Bott, and more recently, I soloed in the opening concert of the Welsh Proms with the Cardiff Philharmonic Orchestra.

# No, I'll fix it. I'm good at fixing rot. Call me the Rotmeister. No, I'm the Doctor. Don't call me the Rotmeister.

Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time! You hit me with a cricket bat. They're not aliens, they're Earth…liens! I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship.

No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness. I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why. Annihilate? No. No violence. __I won't stand for it.__ *Not now, not ever, do you understand me?!* I'm the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm - and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn't you?

## Did I mention we have comfy chairs?

You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas? Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish. Stop talking, brain thinking. Hush. I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me!

1. The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things.…hey.…the good things don't always soften the bad things; but vice-versa the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant.
2. I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks!
3. I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me!

### Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish.

*Insistently* Bow ties are cool! Come on Amy, I'm a normal bloke, tell me what normal blokes do! Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish. Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I've always known him: Jeff.

* I'm the Doctor, I'm worse than everyone's aunt. *catches himself* And that is not how I'm introducing myself.
* They're not aliens, they're Earth…liens!

Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I've always known him: Jeff. It's art! A statement on modern society, 'Oh Ain't Modern Society Awful?'! Did I mention we have comfy chairs? Annihilate? No. No violence. I won't stand for it. Not now, not ever, do you understand me?! I'm the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm - and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn't you?

Saving the world with meals on wheels. It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool. You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME! I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship.

All I've got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong? Saving the world with meals on wheels. You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better?

You've swallowed a planet! No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness. You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better?
